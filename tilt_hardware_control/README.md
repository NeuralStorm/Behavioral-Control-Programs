# Tilt Hardware Control


## Important Note

The Moxon Neurorobotics Laboratory maintains a [Codebase Master Document](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/icsjygmi2bkcv1275xskigibiewahd3p) that introduces users to key concepts that are helpful for properly understanding, installing, and using these programs. It is highly recommended that new users and lab members review the document in its entirety before proceeding.
